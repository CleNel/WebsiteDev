The goal of this project was to design and build a fully responsive personal portfolio website to showcase my work, projects, and professional background. I wanted the site to serve as both a creative expression and a practical tool for connecting with potential collaborators or employers.

To achieve this, I developed the site entirely from scratch using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, focusing on accessibility, responsiveness, and modern design principles. The process involved:

- **Layout and structure:** I planned and implemented a clean, semantic HTML structure to ensure readability, maintainability, and SEO friendliness.  
- **Styling and design:** Using custom CSS (including variables, grid, and flexbox), I created a consistent visual identity with light and dark modes, dynamic color schemes, and a responsive design that adapts seamlessly to mobile, tablet, and desktop.  
- **Interactivity:** I used vanilla JavaScript to implement interactive features, such as expandable project cards, smooth navigation, and dynamic content rendering from Markdown files.  
- **Performance optimization:** I streamlined image assets, optimized CSS and JavaScript for efficiency, and ensured fast loading times.  
- **Version control and deployment:** The project is tracked using GitHub for version control, with deployment via Cloudflare to make the site publicly accessible.  

The result is a fully functional personal website that balances aesthetics and usability, providing a professional platform for presenting projects and enabling easy contact through integrated links and forms.
